# Zumi Obstacle Classification
A Machine Learning project written with Python in Jupyter Notebook to instruct Zumi to classify two objects using the k-NN and Logistic Regression algorithms. 

**Zumi Website:** https://www.robolink.com/products/zumi

This project trains Zumi with a `soft toy` and `plastic cup`. 
Download **all** files (including pickled data files) and follow instructions in the Juypter Notebook file (zumi-final-code.ipynb)

### Classifying Objects Using Pickled Data
This project can be run two different ways to classify objects:
1. Classify objects using data points *without* noise.
2. Classify objects using data **with noise**.

#### Classify Without Noise
1. Under **"Data Collection"**, run the first cell of code.

2. Run the second cell of code.

3. Do not run the cell under **"Data Collection - *collect data without noise*"**.
4. Do not run the cell under **"Data Augmentation - *collect data with noise*"**.

### Data Collection
This project can be run two different ways to collect data points for classifying objects:
1. Collect data points *without* adding noise.
2. Collect data points and augment the data (add noise).
